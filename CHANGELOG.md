# Changelog

Notable changes, newest first. Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## 1.1.0

First public release.

- `PlaywrightFlowProbe` runs C# flows (`BasePlaywrightFlow<TConfig>`) in Chrome over CDP, each with typed settings
  from `FlowConfiguration:<FlowName>`; `PlaywrightFlowAssertion` reports each flow's result with a failure
  screenshot, every pop-up the flow left open, and the run's warnings.
- Settings are checked strictly before the browser opens: unknown keys, values that do not convert, unresolved
  `${...}`, and each flow's own settings, all reported at once.
- Each run gets a browser context of its own (`IsolateContext`); a login can be saved once and reused
  (`SaveStorageStatePath`, `LoadStorageStatePath`); `ForEach` runs a flow once per generated item, with
  `Parallelism` workers.
- `BrowserUrl` defaults to `http://localhost:9222`, where the probe starts Chrome when none answers.
- `EmulateDesktopPointer` makes a headless Chrome render the desktop layout.
- Secrets are hidden in failures, warnings, the report and log properties.
- The recorder, the .NET tool `qaas-playwright`, records in its own Chrome session and writes clean flows: stable
  locators, one method per step, an Expect after each action, and every typed or chosen value as a setting.
